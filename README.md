# my-games

Hard work and dedication has gone into these im just one person i make nothing off of doing this so feel free to buy me a drink at: https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/09jb


These are my games ive made

1.arcade shooter 1.0 is a basic game i created to test out mechanics for the 2.0 version if you wanted to download and play that one go ahead you will be able to see the huge difference between games. 

2.my next project was do not press the big red button which originally started out as a cookie clicker game inspired by the one off of steam which was a huge flop, full of bugs and just wasnt exactly fun to look at or play so i made some changes and hope its a bit more fun. 

3.each file is a .html file so they will open in your browser, all saved data like game progress and account details are all saved in your local storage on your computer i do not have access to these, there is no server where anything is uploaded so it fill run through your files these games are not websites. 

4.arcade shooter 1.0 was about a 1 and a half day project and the 2.0 version was about a week long project. 
the do not press the big red button project was being worked in the background the whole time which also took about a week to finish,

5.these games are not amazing so i wouldnt get your hopes up too much but i do plan on updating all these games and bring some more in the future. obiviously they are not online games and i wont be able to just update it for everyone so youll need to come back every once in a while to see if ive posted an update or uploaded any more games. 

6. enjoy
